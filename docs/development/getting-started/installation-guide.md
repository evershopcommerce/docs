# Installation guide

The following installation guides will guide you step-by-step to create a new EverShop project and get it started.

:::info

Please check [this document](/docs/development/getting-started/system-requirements) for the system requirements list.

:::

## Install EverShop Using `create-evershop-app` command

```bash
npx create-evershop-app my-evershop-app
```

The `create-evershop-app` command will create a new folder named `my-evershop-app` and install all of the dependencies for you.

## Install EverShop Using Docker

You can get started with EverShop in minutes by using the Docker image. The Docker image is a great way to get started with EverShop without having to worry about installing dependencies or configuring your environment.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evershopcommerce/evershop/main/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

The Docker image will start a fresh EverShop installation with the default configuration. You can access the site at `http://localhost:3000` and the admin panel at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.

:::info
To create a new admin user, terminal into the Docker app container and run the following command:

```bash
npm run user:create -- --email "your email" --password "your password" --name "your name"
```

:::

:::caution
The public Docker image is for installing EverShop in your local environment only. If you are looking for a development solution, please check the development section below.

## Install EverShop manually using Npm

</div>

### Step 1: Install The @evershop/evershop Npm Package

`@evershop/evershop` is the core of the EverShop platform. It contains all of the core modules like `catalog`, `checkout`, `order`.

```js title="Install the @evershop/evershop Npm package"
npm init -y;
npm install @evershop/evershop;
```

### Step 2: Install the core Npm scripts

Open the package.json file and add the following scripts:

```js title="Add the core npm scripts"
"scripts": {
    "setup": "evershop install",
    "build": "evershop build",
    "start": "evershop start",
    "start:debug": "evershop start --debug",
    "user:create": "evershop user:create",
    "user:changePassword": "evershop user:changePassword"
}
```

### Step 3: Run the installation script

Before running this script, make sure that you have an empty Postgres database ready for EverShop. If you need help setting up a PostgreSQL database, please refer to the [PostgreSQL setup guide](/docs/development/knowledge-base/database.md) for detailed instructions

:::info
Please check [this document](/docs/development/getting-started/system-requirements) for the system requirements list.
:::

This installation script will do the following tasks:

- Create a default configuration file.
- Create your administrator user.

```js title="Installation script"
npm run setup
```

:::caution
During the installation process, you will be asked for some information like database connection, your shop informationâ€¦
:::

### Step 4: Folder permission

EverShop needs to write some files to the disk. So you need to make sure that the following folders have the write permission:

- `public/`
- `.evershop`
- `.log`
- `media`

### Step 5: Run the `build` command to build the site

```js title="Build the site"
npm run build
```

### Step 6: Run the `start` command to start your store in production mode

```js title="Start the site"
npm run start
```

Your site will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

Admin panel can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.

## Upgrade EverShop

To upgrade EverShop version, you can run the following command:

```js title="Upgrade EverShop"
npm install @evershop/evershop@latest
```

EverShop will take care of the database migration for you.

:::caution
Upgrading EverShop requires running the `build` command again.
:::

## For developer

If you are a developer and want to start the project in the development mode, there are some additional steps you need to follow.

### Install some additional dependencies for development

To run the project in development mode, you need to install some additional dependencies. These dependencies are not required for production but are essential for development.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node typescript @parcel/watcher @types/config @types/express @types/pg @types/react execa
```

### Adding the `dev` script to the package.json file.

Open the package.json and add the following script:

```js title="Add the core dev script"
"scripts": {
    "dev": "evershop dev"
}
```

### Adding the workspace configuration

Open the package.json and add the following configuration:

```js title="Adding the workspace configuration"
 "workspaces": [
    "extensions/*", #This is where you put your extensions
    "themes/*", #This is where you put your themes
  ],
```

### Start the project in development mode

```js title="Start the site in development mode"
npm run dev
```

### The debug mode

To run the project in debug mode, you are required to add the debugging script to the `package.json` file.

```js title="Add the debugging scripts"
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "start:debug": "evershop start --debug",
}
```

And then you can run the project in debug mode by running the following commands:

```js title="Start the site in debug mode"
npm run start:debug
```

And then you can run the project in debug mode by running the following commands:

```js title="Start the site in debug mode"
npm run start:debug
```

:::info
The debug mode is enabled by default when you run the `dev` command.
:::

### Dockerize your project - Build your own Docker image

You can build your own Docker image by using the following `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g npm@9
COPY package*.json .
# Copy your custom theme.
COPY themes ./themes

# Copy your custom extensions.
COPY extensions ./extensions

# Copy your config.
COPY config ./config

# Copy your media.
COPY media ./media

# Copy your public files.
COPY public ./public

# Copy your translations.
COPY translations ./translations

# Run npm install.
RUN npm install

# Build assets.
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

And this is the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: always
    environment:
      DB_HOST: database
      DB_PORT: 5432
      DB_PASSWORD: postgres
      DB_USER: postgres
      DB_NAME: postgres
    networks:
      - myevershop
    depends_on:
      - database
    ports:
      - 3000:3000

  #The postgres database:
  database:
    image: postgres:16
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    networks:
      - myevershop

networks:
  myevershop:
    name: MyEverShop
    driver: bridge

volumes:
